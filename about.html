          <h3>From The Author: Chrissy Pushkin</h3>
          <p>
            This website has been created so that I can teach you how to make
            origami – the Japanese art of paper folding. The word Origami is a
            Japanese word – 折り, which is the combination of the words Ori 折り
            – to fold and Kami 紙 – which means paper. As well as some
            traditional models, I try my best to make tutorials for more unique
            and original designs. Coming up with new origami designs is
            something I really enjoy doing in my spare time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The origami instructions are often video tutorials, because I find
            that it is the easiest way to learn origami and for me to teach it
            to you. You will find lots of tutorials on how to make paper boxes,
            bows, envelopes, mini books, flowers, butterflies, Japanese
            characters like Totoro and Hello Kitty, there are simple
            instructions for beginners and challenging designs for advanced
            folders too.
          </p>
          <h3>Who Runs Paper Kawaii?</h3>
          <p>
            Hi there! I’m Chrissy and I live in Australia. Since a young age, I
            have enjoyed making origami and paper craft projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in 2008 I started posting every now and then just as a small
            hobby, now many years later it has become more of an enjoyable full
            time occupation.
          </p>
          <p>
            My day job is graphic designer / web designer / video editor. Seeing
            people post photos of origami/crafts they have made after following
            one of my tutorials is rewarding and motivating. If you have made
            something from a tutorial, please feel free to tag me (@paperkawaii)
            on instagram or twitter.
